I'm starting a daily dev blog to document interesting problems, solutions, and experiments as I work on client projects and side builds.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover:

- **Architecture decisions** - Why I chose certain tech stacks for specific problems
- **Code solutions** - Practical snippets and patterns I find useful
- **Performance optimization** - Real-world speed improvements
- **Tool discoveries** - New libraries, frameworks, or CLI tools
- **Client work insights** - Anonymized lessons from production systems

## Why Daily?

Writing daily forces me to:
1. Reflect on what I learned
2. Articulate solutions clearly
3. Build a searchable knowledge base
4. Share wins and failures

Some posts will be short (200 words), others deeper dives (1000+ words). The goal is consistency, not perfection.

## Format

Each post will be:
- **Quick to read** - Most posts under 5 minutes
- **Code-heavy** - Real examples, not theory
- **Practical** - Things you can use immediately

Let's build in public.
