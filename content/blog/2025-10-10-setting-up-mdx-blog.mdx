Today I built a custom MDX blog system for my portfolio site. The goal was to have full control over styling while keeping the content workflow simple and static.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This means I can:

- Write content in plain Markdown
- Embed custom React components when needed
- Keep everything version-controlled
- Deploy as static files

## The Setup

The architecture is straightforward:

```typescript
// File structure
/content/blog/
  2025-10-10-post-slug.mdx
/pages/blog/
  index.tsx          // Blog listing
  [slug].tsx         // Individual posts
```

### Dependencies

I'm using:
- `gray-matter` for parsing frontmatter
- `next-mdx-remote` for rendering MDX in static exports
- `rehype-highlight` for syntax highlighting

```bash
npm install gray-matter next-mdx-remote rehype-highlight
```

## Content Structure

Each post is an MDX file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-10-10"
excerpt: "A brief description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

## Static Generation

The blog uses Next.js static generation:

1. `getStaticPaths` - Reads all MDX files, generates routes
2. `getStaticProps` - Parses frontmatter and content for each post
3. Static HTML generated at build time

## What's Next?

Some features I'm planning to add:

- Tag filtering
- Reading time estimates
- Table of contents for longer posts
- RSS feed generation

This setup gives me the flexibility to write daily dev logs with custom components when I need them, while keeping the deployment simple and fast.
